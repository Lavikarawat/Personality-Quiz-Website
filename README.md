A fully functional personality quiz web app built using HTML, CSS, and beginner-level JavaScript. This project takes users through a simple and interactive flow where they can explore different personality types, take a quiz, and get instant results.

🧠 Features
Homepage (index.html) with a button to start the quiz journey.

Quiz Selection Page with two options:

Personality Test: Takes users to a quiz experience.

Types of Personalities: Shares basic info on different personality categories.

Information Form Page where users enter name, age, and gender.

Quiz Page with multiple-choice questions.

Result Page displaying a personality type (A, B, C, or D) based on responses.

⚙️ Technology Used
HTML5 – Page structure

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Beginner-level scripting for interactivity and quiz logic

⚠️ Known Issue
Currently, the JavaScript logic for quiz result evaluation needs improvement.
The quiz returns a random or incorrect personality type (A/B/C/D), due to simple or faulty logic.
This is a known issue and part of ongoing improvements.


🔧 Future Improvements
Debug and fix result evaluation logic in JavaScript

Replace generic result letters (A/B/C/D) with meaningful personality descriptions

Improve layout with responsive design and animations

Add result saving and sharing functionality

💡 Learning Goals
This project was created as a beginner-level practice to:

Learn and apply JavaScript basics (DOM, event handling)

Understand multi-page website structure

Build functional forms and quizzes

Improve front-end development confidence
